        <h2>Borscht</h2>
        <p>Borscht is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word "borscht" is associated with the soup's variant of Ukranian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients.</p>
        <p>The dish derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed, a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time it evolved into adiverse array of tart soups, among which the Ukranian beet-based red borscht has become the most popular.</p>
        <p>It is typically made by combining meat broth with sautéed vegetables, which usually include  cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes, as well as beetroots. Borscht may include meat or be purely vegetarian.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium beets, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>8 cups chicken broth, + 2 cups water</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables (keeping sliced potatoes in cold water to prevent browning until ready to use the drain)</li>
            <li>Heat a large soup pot (5 1/2 Qt or larger) over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive oil. Add grated beets and sauté 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until beets are softened.</li>
            <li>Add 8 cups broth and 2 cups water. Add sliced potatoes and sliced carrots then cook for 10-15 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. Add chopped onion, celery and bell pepper. Saute stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden (7-8 minutes). Add 4 Tbsp tomato sauce and stir fry 30 seconds then transfer to the soup pot to continue cooking with the potatoes.</li>
            <li>When potatoes and carrots reach desired softness, add 1 can of beans with their juice, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1 pressed garlic clove, and 3 Tbsp chopped dill. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes and add more salt and vinegar to taste.</li>
